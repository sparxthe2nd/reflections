What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden folder .git is created. Git has to store the version data somewhere

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Its like the recycle bin. You can move a file, ready deletion, but you can also restore it again. If you're ready to delete, you can delete all at once. The staging area just commits in stead.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You add files until you think you have enough for logical change and first then commit.
